Key UML Components Explained:
Actors:
•	Primary Actor: Clerical Staff (responsible for all report generation)
Use Cases Grouped by Category:
Country Reports (C1-C6):
•	UC1: All countries worldwide (largest → smallest population)
•	UC2: All countries in continent (largest → smallest population)
•	UC3: All countries in region (largest → smallest population)
•	UC4: Top N countries worldwide (user provides N)
•	UC5: Top N countries in continent (user provides N)
•	UC6: Top N countries in region (user provides N)
City Reports (D1-D4):
•	UC7: All cities worldwide (largest → smallest population)
•	UC8: All cities in continent (largest → smallest population)
•	UC9: All cities in region (largest → smallest population)
•	UC10: All cities in country (largest → smallest population)

Relationships:
Extension Points (Error Handling):
•	Data Access Error: Affects UC2, UC3, UC4, UC5, UC6, UC7, UC8, UC9, UC10
•	Invalid Input Error: Affects UC4, UC5, UC6 (where user provides N)
Include Relationships (Common Functionality):
•	Data Retrieval and Sorting: Required by all use cases
•	Report Generation and Formatting: Required by all use cases
System Boundary:
•	Population Reporting System: Contains all use cases within the data management platform
Preconditions (Applied to All):
•	User authentication and authorization
•	Access to current, validated population data
•	Proper system functionality
Success Conditions:
•	Reports generated with correct sorting (largest → smallest population)
•	Data presented in usable format for organizational needs
Failed Conditions:
•	Data retrieval errors
•	Invalid user inputs
